## What does it do?
This extension provides option to translate content elements and tca record fields to desired language(supported by [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/en/api.html)). As a fallback, Google translate option is also provided as they provide support for many languages that deepl isn’t providing.

For both Deepl translate and Google translate, there are two modes-normal and autodetect, where the later autodetects source language and translates it to the desired language.

## Translating TCA records

Deepltranslate supports translation of specific fields of TCA records.It understands fields which need to be translated, only if their ``` l10n_mode ``` is set to ``` prefixLangTitle ```.

For example if you need translation of fields of tx_news (teaser and bodytext),You need to override those fields like follows:

Add it to TCA/Overrides: 
Example : ``` typo3conf/ext/theme/Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tx_news_domain_model_news.php ```

```
<?php

defined('TYPO3_MODE') or die();

$GLOBALS['TCA']['tx_news_domain_model_news']['columns']['bodytext']['l10n_mode'] = 'prefixLangTitle';
$GLOBALS['TCA']['tx_news_domain_model_news']['columns']['teaser']['l10n_mode'] = 'prefixLangTitle';

```

## Deepl Module Settings
The settings module helps to assign the sytem languages to either deepl supported languages or to Google supported languages.

For example you can assign German under Austrian German sys language if you wish. For assigning a language to a sys language you must enter it’s isocode(ISO 639-1).
